# Monthly-Calendar-in-C

I recently worked on a C program to generate the calendar for any given month and year. The program calculates the number of days in the month (handling leap years accurately!) and determines the day of the week for the 1st day of the month. Using this information, it prints a neatly formatted calendar.

✨ Highlights:

Accounts for leap years.
Generates calendars for any month and year.
Displays the days of the week in an intuitive format.
🧑‍💻 Programming in C has always been an exciting journey, and this project showcases how logic and basic programming can create something functional and visually appealing.
